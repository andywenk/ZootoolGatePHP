ZootoolGatePHP
=============

--- this is still under development, but you know: release often and early ;-) ---

This is a wrapper for the zootool.com API. For a full description of the API visit
http://zootool.com/api/docs/general. The API is also still under development and
will change. So check out the updates.

There is already a nice one written by 
Adam Hopkins http://adamhopkinson.co.uk/zoophp. The approach here is a little different
so I thought it's worth publishing it.
